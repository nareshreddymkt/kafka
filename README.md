Assessment: 

Search API-
 
Build a Vertx or Netty rest API that returns a list of jobs searched by keyword, posted_date, availability (fulltime or part-time), and other fields as necessary shown in this UI.

This needs to query a MySQL db to return resultsets,. When using netty, use REST Express API library.
 
Job Post API
The job post API is a verx or netty rest API that adds a job into a kafka queue.
 
Kafka Consumer
Write a simple Kafka consumer that can read the job post from Kafka every time there’s an event and add it into the mysql Db.
 
Write unit test cases and load test the app with 100k jobs posted into the kafka queue and measuring the amount of time it takes to complete writing those jobs into mysql.
 
Send the results along with the assignment submission.
 
Time for assignment:
5 days
 
How to do this assignment:
Start this off as an open source project. Commit everyday based on the progress that you’re making. We need to be able to see a history of commits into this new open source repository.
 
Host the REST API on an amazon microinstance and send a link so that the API can be tested using Postman.
 
Evaluation is done on the basis of:

Quality of code
Design quality
Implementation speed
Data structure designed
Functionality and how well it works.
